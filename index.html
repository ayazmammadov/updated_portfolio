      <h2>About</h2>
    
      <p>I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Departments of Political Science and Scientific Computing (MICDE), with a dual M.S. degree in Statistics, at the University of Michigan. I study international relations and quantitative methods with a secondary focus in comparative politics.
      </p>


      <p>My research and teaching address a variety of topics related to political violence, including the causes and consequences of civil wars, terrorism, state repression, and forced migration, with a special emphasis on the broader Eurasian region. My research has been published in the Journal of Peace Research. Drafts of my published and working papers can be found on my research page and google scholar.</p>
